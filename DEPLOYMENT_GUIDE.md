## Common Issues

**Problem**: Site shows 404
**Solution**: Wait 5 minutes, then refresh. GitHub Pages takes time to deploy.

**Problem**: Styling looks broken
**Solution**: Make sure you uploaded styles.css in the same folder as HTML files.

**Problem**: Links don't work
**Solution**: Check that all HTML files are in the root folder (not in a subfolder).
